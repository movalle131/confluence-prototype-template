/**
 * __Container avatar__
 *
 * This component has been introduced specifically for the Nav4 sidebar because the existing Avatar component
 * did not offer the correct sizes to align with the designs. It was necessary to create a new component rather than
 * using the ADS image component because that did not allow the ability to set the border and radius and the desired
 * presentation was not achievable through nesting within another styled component. At some point this component maybe
 * removed if the Avatar component is updated to allow for the desired presentation.
 *
 * A container avatar to be used in sidebar navigation items.
