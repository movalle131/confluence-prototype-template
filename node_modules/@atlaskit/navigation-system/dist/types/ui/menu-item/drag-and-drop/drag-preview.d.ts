 *
 * If no `elemBefore` is provided, then the `elemBefore` will automatically collapse.
 * There is no need to pass in `COLLAPSE_ELEM_BEFORE`. We do this as there is no
 * need to maintain vertical side navigation vertical alignment in the drag preview.
 *
 * Please ensure the drag preview is pushed away from the users pointer
 * (with `pointerOutsideOfPreview()` from Pragmatic drag and drop) by our
 * standard amount (`{x: token('space.200'), y: token('space.100')`)
