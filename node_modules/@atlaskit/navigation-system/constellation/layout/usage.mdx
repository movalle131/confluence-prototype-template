## Usage

Use layout to compose the structure of your application. It also defines the page behavior and
navigational areas.

When applying components to the navigational areas,
[see navigation experience guidelines (Atlassians only)](https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/navx/pages/5104144812).

### The difference between Aside, Panel and Modal dialog

The main difference between Aside, Panel and Modal dialog is their behaviours:

- **Aside** is not collapsible, while **Panel** can be collapsible.
- **Panel** and **Aside** present content alongside the **Main** area, while **Modal dialog** exists
  in a layer above the page.
- On small viewports (1024px and below), the **Panel** becomes an overlay, while the **Aside** moves
  below **Main**.

#### Usage guidance:

- Use **Aside** for content that needs to be constantly visible and accessible without requiring the
  user to open it, or have the ability to close it.
- Use **Panel** for contextual information or tertiary actions that complement the user's workflow.
  Panels enable greater multitasking by functioning as an additional work space, while keeping users
  connected to their primary task.
- Use **Modal dialog** when you need your user to focus their attention on a single or specific
  task, like requiring a decision or action before they can return to their primary task.

## Best practices

### Design using grid in the Main area

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: layoutDo,
		alt: 'A layout with a grid overlay on the Main area.',
	}}
	isFullWidth
>
	When designing, use <a href="/foundations/grid-beta">Grid</a> to position content within the Main
	area only.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: layoutDont,
		alt: 'A layout with a grid overlay on the Main area, but also on the Side nav, Aside and Panel areas.',
	}}
	isFullWidth
>
	Don't include Side nav, Aside or Panel areas as part of your Grid.
</DoDont>
